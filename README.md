# Tableau

Worked on creating a dashboard using the video games sales data across different platforms and genres. 

The final project file shows how the data manipulation was done to visualize the trends and top trending games along with looking at the overall metrics. 

A scorecard was also created to get a high level view of financial, customer, business growth and internal process perspectives for a business.
